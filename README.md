# Smart Inter-Vehicular Communication

As of the present moment, vehicles have very little means of communicating with each other besides the use of horns or visual and auditory indicators. This, however only allows for a very basic and limited form of information transmission. We think with the integration of smart technologies, a whole lot more can be achieved. There would be many applications and use cases like automatically dimming the lights when a signal from a vehicle that’s speeding opposite to you is received, or much faster transmission of critical information from one vehicle to another when accidents or heavy roadblocks occur. We may also use this communication to reduce the number of deadly vehicular collisions by having the vehicles automatically slow down when a collision seems unavoidable. We would be building on existing technologies like VANETs to come up with a solution to implement inter-vehicular communication. Vehicles are undoubtedly a very important part of our lives, and innovating them will surely lead us closer to achieving smarter and safer cities on a wider scale.
